abstract = {Nanoelectronic systems are now more and more prone to faults and defects. Redundancy techniques are implemented widely to increase the reliability. However, many researches are based on the assumption that the voter is perfect while this is not true. This paper proposed a fault-tolerant and simple majority voter structure for TMR. Experimental results show its optimization over the formers.},

@inproceedings{Amiri2013,
abstract = {This article deals with modeling and design of a new fault-tolerant voter circuit. Majority voted redundancy is increasingly implemented in fault-tolerant design today. A voter is used in these implementations to determine a possibly correct result through the majority vote. The reliability of the voter circuit should be much higher than that of the other circuit elements; otherwise it will wipe out the gains of the redundancy scheme. Since almost all the circuit elements are fabricated with the same technology, the voter circuit itself needs to be fault-tolerant. In this paper, we present a novel fault-tolerant voter circuit design with a simple structure, so that it can easily be used for N-modular redundancy implementations as well as for systems with more than a single bit output.},

@article{Fras2010,
abstract = {The Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) technology allows protection of the functionality of FPGAs against single event upsets (SEUs). Each logic block is implemented three times with a 2-out-of-3 voter at the output. Thus, the correct logical value is available even if there is an upset bit in one location. We applied TMR to the configuration code of a Virtex-II-2000 FPGA, which serves as the on-chamber readout processor of the ATLAS monitored drift tubes (MDTs). We describe the code implementation, results of performance measurements and discuss several limitations of the method. Finally, we present a supplementary technology called \&\#x201C;scrubbing\&\#x201D;. It permanently checks the configuration memory while the FPGA is operating, and corrects upset configuration bits when necessary.},
