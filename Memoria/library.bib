@article{Alme2013,
abstract = {Single Event Upsets (SEUs) are a major concern for the TPC Readout Control Unit (RCU) of the ALICE experiment. A SEU is defined as a radiation related bit-flip in a memory cell, and a SEU in the onboard SRAM based FPGA of the RCU may lead to corrupted data or, even worse, a system malfunction. The latter situation will affect the operation of the ALICE detector since it causes a premature end of data taking. Active partial reconfiguration is utilized in a dedicated reconfiguration solution on the RCU, and this makes it possible to implement fault injection. Fault injection means inserting bit flips in the configuration memory of the FPGA in a controlled laboratory environment. This paper presents the results of the fault injection study and shows how this result can be combined with SEU measurements to estimate the functional failure rate as a function of luminosity.},

@article{Pham2013,
abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new approach to implement a reliable softcore processor on SRAM-based FPGAs, which can mitigate radiation-induced temporary faults (single-event upsets (SEUs)) at moderate cost. A new Enhanced Lockstep scheme built using a pair of MicroBlaze cores is proposed and implemented on Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA. Unlike the basic lockstep scheme, ours allows to detect and eliminate its internal temporary configuration upsets without interrupting normal functioning. Faults are detected and eliminated using a Configuration Engine built on the basis of the PicoBlaze core which, to avoid a single point of failure, is implemented as fault-tolerant using triple modular redundancy (TMR). A softcore processor can recover from configuration upsets through partial reconfiguration combined with roll-forward recovery. SEUs affecting logic which are significantly less likely than those affecting configuration are handled by checkpointing and rollback. Finally, to handle permanent faults, the tiling technique is also proposed. The new Enhanced Lockstep scheme requires significantly shorter error recovery time compared to conventional lockstep scheme and uses significantly smaller number of slices compared to known TMR-based design (although at the cost of longer error recovery time). The efficiency of the proposed approach was validated through fault injection experiments.},

abstract = {Sources of high-energy cosmic rays can be identi ed by measuring the direction- and energy- ux of cosmic neutrinos. The KM3NeT neutrino detector is being con- structed in the deep Mediterranean sea to detect this ux. Neutrinos of all avors can induce a detectable particle shower in the detector. The direction and energy of this shower gives an estimate of the direction and energy of the neutrino. In this research, a method has been developed to reconstruct the parameters of neutrino- induced showers with energies > 104 GeV in the KM3NeT detector. The performance of the reconstruction method has been tested using simulated shower events. The shower direction can be reconstructed with a median error in the direction of less than 2. The energy resolution is 15\%. By selecting a subset of the reconstructed events, a direction resolution better than 1 can be achieved. The estimated shower position may be suciently accurate to distinguish between electron-and tau-neutrinos. This could lead to a neutrino source analysis based on all properties of detected neutrinos.},

@article{Rotenberg1999,
abstract = {This paper speculates that technology trends pose new challenges for fault tolerance in microprocessors. Specifically, severely reduced design tolerances implied by gigaherz clock rates may result in frequent and arbitrary transient faults. We suggest that existing fault-tolerant techniques-system-level, gate-level, or component-specific approaches-are either too costly for general purpose computing, overly intrusive to the design, or insufficient for covering arbitrary logic faults. An approach in which the microarchitecture itself provides fault tolerance is required. We propose a new time redundancy fault-tolerant approach in which a program is duplicated and the two redundant programs simultaneously run on the processor: The technique exploits several significant microarchitectural trends to provide broad coverage of transient faults and restricted coverage of permanent faults. These trends are simultaneous multithreading, control flow and data flow prediction, and hierarchical processors-all of which are intended for higher performance, but which can be easily leveraged for the specified fault tolerance goals. The overhead for achieving fault tolerance is low, both in terms of performance and changes to the existing microarchitecture. Detailed simulations of five of the SPEC95 benchmarks show that executing two redundant programs on the fault-tolerant microarchitecture takes only 10\% to 30\% longer than running a single version of the program},

abstract = {Reconfigurable computing using field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) offer significant performance improvements over traditional space based processing solutions. The application of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) FPGA processing components requires radiation-effect detection and mitigation strategy to compensate for the FPGAs' susceptibility to single event upsets (SEUs) and single event functional interrupts (SEFIs). A reconfigurable computing architecture that uses external triple modular redundancy (TMR) via a radiation-hardened ASIC provides the most robust approach to SEU and SEFI detection and mitigation. Honeywell has designed a TMR Voter ASIC with an integrated FPGA configuration manager that can automatically reconfigure an upset FPGA upon TMR error detection. The automatic configuration manager also has features to support resynchronizing the upset FPGA with the remaining two FPGAs operating in a self checking pair (SCP) mode. Automating and minimizing reconfiguration times and re synchronization times enables high performance FPGA-based processors to provide high system availability with minimal software/system controller intervention},

abstract = {We propose a fault-tolerant approach to reliable microprocessor design. Our approach, based on the use of an online checker component in the processor pipeline, provides significant resistance to core processor design errors and operational faults such as supply voltage noise and energetic particle strikes. We show through cycle-accurate simulation and timing analysis of a physical checker design that our approach preserves system performance while keeping area overheads and power demands low. Furthermore, analyses suggest that the checker is a fairly simple state machine that can be formally verified, scaled in performance, and reused. Further simulation analyses show virtually no performance impacts when our simple checker design is coupled with a high-performance microprocessor model. Timing analyses indicate that a fully synthesized unpipelined 4-wide checker component in 0.25 \&amp;mu;m technology is capable of checking Alpha instructions at 288 MHz. Physical analyses also confirm that costs are quite modest; our prototype checker requires less than 6\% the area and 1.5\% the power of an Alpha 21264 processor in the same technology. Additional improvements to the checker component are described which allow for improved detection of design, fabrication and operational faults.},

abstract = {The increasing transient fault rate necessitates on-chip fault tolerance techniques in future processors. The speed gap between the processor and the memory is also increasing, causing the processor to stay idle for hundreds of cycles while waiting for a long-latency cache miss to be serviced. Even in the presence of aggressive prefetching techniques, future processors are expected to waste significant processing bandwidth waiting for main memory. This paper proposes microarchitecture-based introspection (MBI), a transient-fault detection technique, which utilizes the wasted processing bandwidth during long-latency cache misses for redundant execution of the instruction stream. MBI has modest hardware cost, requires minimal modifications to the existing microarchitecture, and is particularly well suited for memory-intensive applications. Our evaluation reveals that the time redundancy of MBI results in an average IPC reduction of only 7.1 \%for memory-intensive benchmarks in the SPEC CPU2000 suite. The average IPC reduction for the entire suite is 14.5\%.},

We quantify the SER due to high-energy neutrons in SRAM cells, latches, and logic circuits for feature sizes from 600 nm to 50 nm and clock periods from 16 to 6 fan-out-of-4 inverter delays. Our model predicts that the SER per chip of logic circuits will increase nine orders of magnitude from 1992 to 2011 and at that point will be comparable to the SER per chip of unprotected memory elements. Our result emphasizes that computer system designers must address the risks of soft errors in logic circuits for future designs.},

A voter is used in these implementations to determine a possibly correct result through the majority vote. The reliability of the voter circuit should be much higher than that of the other circuit elements; otherwise it will wipe out the gains of the redundancy scheme. Since almost all the circuit elements are fabricated with the same technology, the voter circuit itself needs to be fault-tolerant. In this paper, we present a novel fault-tolerant voter circuit design with a simple structure, so that it can easily be used for N-modular redundancy implementations as well as for systems with more than a single bit output.},

abstract = {This book was written to serve the needs of practicing engineers and computer scientists, and for students from a variety of backgrounds—computer science and engineering, electrical engineering, mathematics, operations research, and other disciplines—taking college- or professional-level courses. The field of high-reliability, high-availability, fault-tolerant computing was developed for the critical needs of military and space applications. NASA deep-space missions are costly, for they require various redundancy and recovery schemes to avoid total failure. Advances in military aircraft design led to the development of electronic flight controls, and similar systems were later incorporated in the Airbus 330 and Boeing 777 passenger aircraft, where flight controls are triplicated to permit some elements to fail during aircraft operation. The reputation of the Tandem business computer is built on NonStop computing, a comprehensive redundancy scheme that improves reliability. Modern computer storage uses redundant array of independent disks (RAID) techniques to link 50–100 disks in a fast, reliable system. Various ideas arising from fault-tolerant computing are now used in nearly all commercial, military, and space computer systems; in the transportation, health, and entertainment industries; in institutions of education and government; in telephone systems; and in both fossil and nuclear power plants. Rapid developments in microelectronics have led to very complex designs; for example, a luxury automobile may have 30–40 microprocessors connected by a local area network! Such designs must be made using fault-tolerant techniques to provide significant software and hardware reliability, availability, and safety. Computer networks are currently of great interest, and their successful operation requires a high degree of reliability and availability. This reliability is achieved by means of multiple connecting paths among locations within a network so that when one path fails, transmission is successfully rerouted. Thus the network topology provides a complex structure of redundant paths that, in turn, provide fault tolerance, and these principles also apply to power distribution, telephone and water systems, and other networks. Fault-tolerant computing is a generic term describing redundant design techniques with duplicate components or repeated computations enabling uninterrupted (tolerant) operation in response to component failure (faults). Sometimes, system disasters are caused by neglecting the principles of redundancy and failure independence, which are obvious in retrospect. After the September 11th, 2001, attack on the World Trade Center, it was revealed that although one company had maintained its primary system database in one of the twin towers, it wisely had kept its backup copies at its Denver, Colorado office. Another company had also maintained its primary system database in one tower but, unfortunately, kept its backup copies in the other tower.},

The first prototypes were manufactured on the Atmel ATC35 0.35 \&amp;mu;m CMOS process, and subjected to heavy-ion fault-injection at the Louvain Cyclotron. The heavy-ion tests showed that all of the injected errors (>100,000) were successfully corrected without timing or software impact.

abstract = {The mitigation of single event upsets (SEUs) in field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) is an increasingly important subject as both the static random access memory (SRAM) cells and the logic circuits in FPGAs are susceptible to SEUs. Among all SEU mitigation techniques, the triple modular redundancy (TMR) has become the most common practice because of its straightforward implementation and reliable results. The methodologies to perform partitioning TMR insertion to reduce SEUs in the FPGA logic paths are presented in this paper. It is proved that the maximal probability of two simultaneous errors decreases dramatically with the number of logic partitions in the TMR designs. It is reduced from 66.67\% for minimum logic partition to 4.44\% for maximum logic partition for the test circuit. The results presented in this paper suggest that there is a tradeoff between the number of logic partitions and combination property of TMR designs. For ground-based systems such as nuclear power plant (NPPs), where the overhead is insignificant, especially compared to reliability requirements, the maximum partition can be the best. While in space applications where area is at a premium, the optimal logic partition should be the medium partition.},

abstract = {The harsh radiation environment of space, the propensity for SEUs to perturb the operations of silicon-based electronics, the rapid development of microprocessor capabilities and hence software applications, and the high cost (dollars and time) to develop and prove a system, require flexible, reliable, low cost, rapidly developed system solutions. A reconfigurable triple-modular-redundant (TMR) system-on-a-chip (SOC) utilizing field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) provides a practical solution for space-based systems. The configurable fault-tolerant processor (CFTP) is such a system, designed specifically for the purpose of testing and evaluating, on orbit, both the reliability of instantiated TMR soft-core microprocessors, the ability to reconfigure the system to support any onboard processor function, and the means for detecting and correcting SEU-induced configuration faults. The CFTP utilizes commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) technology to investigate a low-cost, flexible alternative to processor hardware architecture, with a total-ionizing-dose (TID) tolerant FPGA as the basis for a SOC. The flexibility of a configurable processor, based on FPGA technology, enables on-orbit upgrades, reconfigurations, and modifications to the soft-core architecture in order to support dynamic mission requirements. Single event upsets (SEU) to the data stored in the FPGA-based soft-core processors are detected and corrected by the TMR architecture. SEUs affecting the FPGA configuration itself are corrected by background "scrubbing" of the configuration. The CFTP payload consists of a printed circuit board (PCB) of 5.3 inches\&amp;times;7.3 inches utilizing a slightly modified PC/104 bus interface. The initial FPGA configuration is an instantiation of a TMR processor, with included error detection and correction (EDAC) and memory controller circuitry. The PCB is designed with requisite supporting circuitry including a configuration controller FPGA, SDRAM, and flash memory in order to allow the greatest variety of possible configurations. The CFTP is currently manifested as a space test program (STP) experimental payload on the Naval Postgraduate School's NPSAT1 and the United States Naval Academy's MidSTAR-1 satellites, which was launched into low earth orbit in March 2003- .},

abstract = {The era of seemingly unlimited growth in processor performance is over: single chip architectures can no longer overcome the performance limitations imposed by the power they consume and the heat they generate. Today, Intel and other semiconductor firms are abandoning the single fast processor model in favor of multi-core microprocessors-chips that combine two or more processors in a single package. In the fourth edition of emphComputer Architecture, the authors focus on this historic shift, increasing their coverage of multiprocessors and exploring the most effective ways of achieving parallelism as the key to unlocking the power of multiple processor architectures. Additionally, the new edition has expanded and updated coverage of design topics beyond processor performance, including power, reliability, availability, and dependability. textbfCD System Requirements emphPDF Viewer The CD material includes PDF documents that you can read with a PDF viewer such as Adobe, Acrobat or Adobe Reader.

@article{Ibrahim2013,
abstract = {This paper presents the design of a reconfigurable avionics system based on modern Static Random Access Memory (SRAM)-based Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) to be used in future generations of nano satellites. A major concern in satellite systems and especially nano satellites is to build robust systems with low-power consumption profiles. The system is designed to be flexible by providing the capability of reconfiguring itself based on its orbital position. As Single Event Upsets (SEU) do not have the same severity and intensity in all orbital locations, having the maximum at the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) and the polar cusps, the system does not have to be fully protected all the time in its orbit. An acceptable level of protection against high-energy cosmic rays and charged particles roaming in space is provided within the majority of the orbit through software fault tolerance. Check pointing and roll back, besides control flow assertions, is used for that level of protection. In the minority part of the orbit where severe SEUs are expected to exist, a reconfiguration for the system FPGA is initiated where the processor systems are triplicated and protection through Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) with feedback is provided. This technique of reconfiguring the system as per the level of the threat expected from SEU-induced faults helps in reducing the average dynamic power consumption of the system to one-third of its maximum. This technique can be viewed as a smart protection through system reconfiguration. The system is built on the commercial version of the (XC5VLX50) Xilinx Virtex5 FPGA on bulk silicon with 324 IO. Simulations of orbit SEU rates were carried out using the SPENVIS web-based software package.},

@book{Investigation2008,
abstract = {On 7 October 2008, an Airbus A330-303 aircraft, registered VH-QPA and operated as Qantas flight 72, departed Singapore on a scheduled passenger transport service to Perth, Western Australia. While the aircraft was in cruise at 37,000 ft, one of the aircraft’s three air data inertial reference units (ADIRUs) started outputting intermittent, incorrect values (spikes) on all flight parameters to other aircraft systems. Two minutes later, in response to spikes in angle of attack (AOA) data, the aircraft’s flight control primary computers (FCPCs) commanded the aircraft to pitch down. At least 110 of the 303 passengers and nine of the 12 crew members were injured; 12 of the occupants were seriously injured and another 39 received hospital medical treatment. Although the FCPC algorithm for processing AOA data was generally very effective, it could not manage a scenario where there were multiple spikes in AOA from one ADIRU that were 1.2 seconds apart. The occurrence was the only known example where this design limitation led to a pitch-down command in over 28 million flight hours on A330/A340 aircraft, and the aircraft manufacturer subsequently redesigned the AOA algorithm to prevent the same type of accident from occurring again. Each of the intermittent data spikes was probably generated when the LTN-101 ADIRU’s central processor unit (CPU) module combined the data value from one parameter with the label for another parameter. The failure mode was probably initiated by a single, rare type of internal or external trigger event combined with a marginal susceptibility to that type of event within a hardware component. There were only three known occasions of the failure mode in over 128 million hours of unit operation. At the aircraft manufacturer’s request, the ADIRU manufacturer has modified the LTN-101 ADIRU to improve its ability to detect data transmission failures. At least 60 of the aircraft’s passengers were seated without their seat belts fastened at the time of the first pitch-down. The injury rate and injury severity was substantially greater for those who were not seated or seated without their seat belts fastened. The investigation identified several lessons or reminders for the manufacturers of complex, safety-critical systems.},

abstract = {Dynamic network reconfiguration is defined as the process of changing from one routing function to another while the network remains up and running. The main challenge is to avoid deadlocks and reduce packet dropping rate while keeping network service. Current approaches either require the existence of extra network resources like e.g. virtual channels, their complexity is so high that their practical applicability is limited, or they affect to the performance of the network during the reconfiguration process. In this paper we present EBR, a simple and fast method for dynamic network reconfiguration. EBR guarantees a fast and deadlock-free reconfiguration, but instead of avoiding deadlocks our mechanism is based on regressive deadlock recoveries. Thus, EBR allows cycles to be formed, and in the situation of a deadlock some packets may be dropped. However, as demonstrated, no packets need to be dropped in the working zone of the system. Also, the mechanism works in an asynchronous manner, does not require additional resources and works on any topology. In order to minimize the number of dropped packets, EBR uses an epoch marking system that guarantees that only packets potentially leading to a deadlock will be removed. Evaluation results show that EBR works efficiently in different topologies and with different routing algorithms. When compared with current proposals, EBR always gets the best numbers in all the analyzed parameters (dropped packets, latency, throughput, reconfiguration time and resources required), thus achieving the good properties of all mechanisms.},

abstract = {This paper presents a circuit level soft error-tolerant-technique, called RRC (robust register caching), for the register file of embedded processors. The basic idea behind the RRC is to effectively cache the most vulnerable registers in a small highly robust register cache built by circuit level SEU and SET protected memory cells. To decide which cache entry should be replaced, the average number of read operations during a register ACE time is used as a criterion to judge. In fact, the victim cache entry is one which has the maximum read count. To minimize the power overhead of the RRC, the clock gating technique is efficiently exploited for the main register file resulting in significantly low power consumption. The RRC is able to protect the register file not only against single bit upsets (SBUs) but also against multiple bit upsets (MBUs) and single event transients (SETs). The RRC is experimentally evaluated using the LEON processor. The experimental results show that, if the cache size is selected properly, the architectural vulnerability factor (AVF) of the register file becomes about 1\% while it imposes low power, area and performance overheads to the processor.},

abstract = {Voting algorithms have been widely used in the realisation of fault-tolerant systems. We introduce a new algorithm of software voting termed as adaptive majority voter. It uses the history of modules of a N-Modular Redundant (NMR) system to select the result of the most reliable module if it contributes toward a majority consensus. Furthermore, a new method for on-line creation of a history record of modules in a Triple Modular Redundant, TMR, system is proposed. The history vector of modules are not only used to improve the behaviour of a wide range of traditional voters, but also can be used to identify the most erroneous/faulty modules of a system to take appropriate reconfiguration or damage preventive strategies. The empirical results show that the novel `adaptive majority voter' has higher safety and availability levels than the traditional majority voter},

The approach uses mixed-mode simulation (electrical/logic analysis), and injects transient errors in run-time to assess the resulting fault-impact. To exemplify the methodology, a fault-tolerant architecture which models the digital aspects of a dual-channel, real-time jet-engine controller is used. The level of effectiveness of the dual configuration with respect to single and multiple transients is measured. The results indicate 100\% coverage of single transients. Approximately 12\% of the multiple transients affect both channels; none result in controller failure since two additional levels of redundancy exist},

abstract = {The vulnerability of microprocessors to soft errors is increasing due to continuous shrinking in fabrication process. Recent studies show that 1\&\#x2013;5\% of the SEUs (single event upset) can cause MBUs (multiple bit upsets). The probability of MBU generation due to SEU is increasing because of the reduction in minimum energy required to flip a memory bit in modern technologies. Register file is the most sensitive component in a microprocessor. In this paper, we present an innovative way to protect registers in a 64-bit register file for a RISC processor using extended Hamming (8, 4) code (SEC-DED code) and narrow-width values. A narrow-width value can be represented by half number of bits of the register width. Two additional bits for each data register have been used to store the information for a narrow-width value. Each 64-bit data in register file has its unique 64-bit extended Hamming code that is stored in another register file in a bit-interleaved manner. Two copies of narrow-width values can be stored in one register and each copy has its unique extended Hamming code in other register file. Proposed method has been tested using fault injection simulation with SPEC2000 benchmarks. Error probability of a word that stores generated values for register file in SPEC2000 benchmarks and is protected with proposed method is less than the error probability of the same word that is protected with TMR or various extended Hamming codes. The implementation on a Xilinx Virtex-4 FPGA shows that the area overhead of a register file with 64-bit wide and more than 64-word entry that is protected with proposed method is less than the area overhead of the same register file that is protected with TMR. Error detection and correction is performed in parallel with execute stage to prevent performance degradation. More than 99\% of errors in adjacent 32 bits in data or extended Hamming code registers can be corrected with the proposed method. Presented method employs pure combinational logics and can be used for 16-bit and 32-bit register files too.},

abstract = {Using reconfigurable, static random-access memory (SRAM) based field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) for space-based computation has been an very active area of research for the past decade. Since both the circuit and the circuitpsilas state are stored in radiation-tolerant memory, both could be altered by the harsh space radiation environment. Both the circuit and the circuitpsilas state can be protected by triple-modular redundancy (TMR), but applying TMR to FPGA user designs is often an error-prone process. Faulty application of TMR could cause the FPGA user circuit to output incorrect data. This paper will describe a three-tiered methodology for testing FPGA user designs for space-readiness. We will describe the standard approach to testing FPGA user designs using a particle accelerator, as well as two methods using fault injection and modeling. While accelerator testing is the current ldquogold standardrdquo for pre-launch testing, we believe the use of fault injection and modeling tools allows for easy, cheap and uniform access for discovering errors earlier in the design process.},

abstract = {SRAM-based field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are vulnerable to a single event upset (SEU), which is induced by radiation effect. This paper presents a technique for ensuring reliable softcore processor implementation on SRAM-based FPGAs. Although an FPGA is susceptible to SEUs, these faults can be corrected as a result of its reconfigurability. We propose techniques for SEU mitigation and recovery of a softcore processor using triple modular redundancy (TMR) and partial reconfiguration (PR) with state synchronization. By carrying out an experiment, we confirm that a faulty softcore processor can be recovered and synchronized with other softcore processors. The proposed technique requires 4.315 times the resource usage and 62.491\% of the operating frequency of the base processor. However, the proposed recovery process only takes 6 \&amp;\#x03BC;s under TMR and PR. As a result of reliability estimation, the proposed system achieved about 2.713 times longer MTBF comparing with the previous system.},

abstract = {The scope, complexity, and pervasiveness of computer-based and controlled systems continue to increase dramatically. The consequences of these systems failing can range from the mildly annoying to catastrophic, with serious injury occurring or lives lost, human-made and natural systems destroyed, security breached, businesses failed, or opportunities lost. As software assumes more of the responsibility of providing functionality and control in systems, it becomes more complex and more significant to the overall system performance and dependability. It would be ideal if the processes by which software is conceptualized, created, analyzed, and tested had advanced to the state that software is devel- oped without errors. Given the current state-of-the-practice, fewer errors are introduced, but not all errors are prevented. So even if we have the best peo- ple and use the best practices and tools, we are still imperfect beings, and it would be very risky to assume that the software we develop is error-free. This book examines the means to protect against software design faults and toler- ate the operational effects of these introduced imperfections. Chapter 1 provides definitions of several basic terms and concepts and a proposed reading guide. Chapter 2 presents various means of structuring redundancy so that it can effect software fault tolerance. Chapter 3 presents programming practices used in several software fault tolerance techniques, along with common problems and issues faced by various approaches to software fault tolerance. The essence of this book is the presentation of the software fault tolerance techniques themselves. Design diverse techniques are presented in Chapter 4, data diverse techniques in Chapter 5, and "other" techniques in Chapter 6. The decision mechanisms used with many of the techniques are presented in Chapter 7. This book may be used as a reference for researchers or practitioners. It may also be used as a textbook or reference for a graduate-level software engi- neering course or for a course on software fault tolerance. A proposed navigational guide to reading the book is provided in Figure 1.1, Section 1.2. Software fault tolerance is not a panacea for all our software problems. Since, at least for the near future, software fault tolerance will primarily be used in critical systems, it is even more important to emphasize that "fault tolerant" does not mean "safe," nor does it cover the other attributes comprising dependability, such as reliability, availability, confidentiality, integrity, and maintainability (as none of these covers fault tolerance). Each must be designed-in and their, at times conflicting, characteristics analyzed. Poor requirements analysis will yield poor software in most cases. Simply applying a software fault tolerance technique prior to testing or fielding a system is not sufficient. Software due diligence is required!},
