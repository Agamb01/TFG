In the survey section, we first define the relevant terminology in the field and then describe the recent evolution of FPDs. The three main categories of FPDs are delineated: Simple PLDs (SPLDs), Complex PLDs (CPLDs) and Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). We then give details of the architectures of all of the most important commercially available chips. The second part of the article gives an overview of the most important research results on FPD architecture over the past six years, and provides suggestions as to features that may be included in future architectures.},

In the fourth edition of emphComputer Architecture, the authors focus on this historic shift, increasing their coverage of multiprocessors and exploring the most effective ways of achieving parallelism as the key to unlocking the power of multiple processor architectures.

@article{Investigation2008,
abstract = {On 7 October 2008, an Airbus A330-303 aircraft, registered VH-QPA and operated as Qantas flight 72, departed Singapore on a scheduled passenger transport service to Perth, Western Australia. While the aircraft was in cruise at 37,000 ft, one of the aircraft’s three air data inertial reference units (ADIRUs) started outputting intermittent, incorrect values (spikes) on all flight parameters to other aircraft systems. Two minutes later, in response to spikes in angle of attack (AOA) data, the aircraft’s flight control primary computers (FCPCs) commanded the aircraft to pitch down. At least 110 of the 303 passengers and nine of the 12 crew members were injured; 12 of the occupants were seriously injured and another 39 received hospital medical treatment. Although the FCPC algorithm for processing AOA data was generally very effective, it could not manage a scenario where there were multiple spikes in AOA from one ADIRU that were 1.2 seconds apart. The occurrence was the only known example where this design limitation led to a pitch-down command in over 28 million flight hours on A330/A340 aircraft, and the aircraft manufacturer subsequently redesigned the AOA algorithm to prevent the same type of accident from occurring again. Each of the intermittent data spikes was probably generated when the LTN-101 ADIRU’s central processor unit (CPU) module combined the data value from one parameter with the label for another parameter. The failure mode was probably initiated by a single, rare type of internal or external trigger event combined with a marginal susceptibility to that type of event within a hardware component. There were only three known occasions of the failure mode in over 128 million hours of unit operation. At the aircraft manufacturer’s request, the ADIRU manufacturer has modified the LTN-101 ADIRU to improve its ability to detect data transmission failures. At least 60 of the aircraft’s passengers were seated without their seat belts fastened at the time of the first pitch-down. The injury rate and injury severity was substantially greater for those who were not seated or seated without their seat belts fastened. The investigation identified several lessons or reminders for the manufacturers of complex, safety-critical systems.},

abstract = {Sources of high-energy cosmic rays can be identi ed by measuring the direction- and energy- ux of cosmic neutrinos. The KM3NeT neutrino detector is being con- structed in the deep Mediterranean sea to detect this ux. Neutrinos of all avors can induce a detectable particle shower in the detector. The direction and energy of this shower gives an estimate of the direction and energy of the neutrino. In this research, a method has been developed to reconstruct the parameters of neutrino- induced showers with energies > 104 GeV in the KM3NeT detector. The performance of the reconstruction method has been tested using simulated shower events. The shower direction can be reconstructed with a median error in the direction of less than 2. The energy resolution is 15\%. By selecting a subset of the reconstructed events, a direction resolution better than 1 can be achieved. The estimated shower position may be suciently accurate to distinguish between electron-and tau-neutrinos. This could lead to a neutrino source analysis based on all properties of detected neutrinos.},

abstract = {This paper examines the effect of technology scaling and microarchitectural trends on the rate of soft errors in CMOS memory and logic circuits. We describe and validate an end-to-end model that enables us to compute the soft error rates (SER) for existing and future microprocessor-style designs. The model captures the effects of two important masking phenomena, electrical masking and latching-window masking, which inhibit soft errors in combinational logic. We quantify the SER due to high-energy neutrons in SRAM cells, latches, and logic circuits for feature sizes from 600 nm to 50 nm and clock periods from 16 to 6 fan-out-of-4 inverter delays. Our model predicts that the SER per chip of logic circuits will increase nine orders of magnitude from 1992 to 2011 and at that point will be comparable to the SER per chip of unprotected memory elements. Our result emphasizes that computer system designers must address the risks of soft errors in logic circuits for future designs.},

abstract = {We propose a fault-tolerant approach to reliable microprocessor design. Our approach, based on the use of an online checker component in the processor pipeline, provides significant resistance to core processor design errors and operational faults such as supply voltage noise and energetic particle strikes. We show through cycle-accurate simulation and timing analysis of a physical checker design that our approach preserves system performance while keeping area overheads and power demands low. Furthermore, analyses suggest that the checker is a fairly simple state machine that can be formally verified, scaled in performance, and reused. Further simulation analyses show virtually no performance impacts when our simple checker design is coupled with a high-performance microprocessor model. Timing analyses indicate that a fully synthesized unpipelined 4-wide checker component in 0.25 \&amp;mu;m technology is capable of checking Alpha instructions at 288 MHz. Physical analyses also confirm that costs are quite modest; our prototype checker requires less than 6\% the area and 1.5\% the power of an Alpha 21264 processor in the same technology. Additional improvements to the checker component are described which allow for improved detection of design, fabrication and operational faults.},
