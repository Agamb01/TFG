abstract = {This document discusses the use of Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) for the protection of combinatorial and sequential logic in reprogrammable logic devices. A VHDL approach has been developed for automatic TMR insertion and a demonstration design has been developed. The approach is called “Functional Triple Modular Redundancy (FTMR)”. This document addresses the protection of random sequential and combinatorial logic. This document does not address the protection of inputs and outputs, the usage of on-chip block memories or dedicated shift-registers etc. It assumes a good knowledge of the Xilinx architecture. For detailed information on Xilinx FPGAs and mitigation techniques such as configuration memory scrubbing, see [RD7].},

abstract = {This specification defines the standard requirements and procedures for terrestrial soft-error-rate (SER) testing of integrated circuits and reporting of results. Both real-time (unaccelerated) and accelerated testing procedures are described. At terrestrial, Earth-based altitudes, the predominant sources of radiation include both cosmic-ray radiation and alpha-particle radiation from radioisotopic impurities in the package and chip materials. An overall assessment of a device\'{\i}s SER is complete, only when an unaccelerated test is done, or accelerated SER data for the alpha-particle component and the cosmic-radiation component has been obtained},
