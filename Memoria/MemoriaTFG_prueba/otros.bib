abstract = {This article provides a tutorial survey of architectures of commercially available high-capacity field-programmable devices (FPDs), and gives a summary of recent research results in the field. In the survey section, we first define the relevant terminology in the field and then describe the recent evolution of FPDs. The three main categories of FPDs are delineated: Simple PLDs (SPLDs), Complex PLDs (CPLDs) and Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). We then give details of the architectures of all of the most important commercially available chips. The second part of the article gives an overview of the most important research results on FPD architecture over the past six years, and provides suggestions as to features that may be included in future architectures.},

A VHDL approach has been developed for automatic TMR insertion and a demonstration design has been developed. The approach is called “Functional Triple Modular Redundancy (FTMR)”. This document addresses the protection of random sequential and combinatorial logic. This document does not address the protection of inputs and outputs, the usage of on-chip block memories or dedicated shift-registers etc. It assumes a good knowledge of the Xilinx architecture.

abstract = {The era of seemingly unlimited growth in processor performance is over: single chip architectures can no longer overcome the performance limitations imposed by the power they consume and the heat they generate. Today, Intel and other semiconductor firms are abandoning the single fast processor model in favor of multi-core microprocessors-chips that combine two or more processors in a single package. In the fourth edition of emphComputer Architecture, the authors focus on this historic shift, increasing their coverage of multiprocessors and exploring the most effective ways of achieving parallelism as the key to unlocking the power of multiple processor architectures. Additionally, the new edition has expanded and updated coverage of design topics beyond processor performance, including power, reliability, availability, and dependability. textbfCD System Requirements emphPDF Viewer The CD material includes PDF documents that you can read with a PDF viewer such as Adobe, Acrobat or Adobe Reader.

abstract = {Sources of high-energy cosmic rays can be identi ed by measuring the direction- and energy- ux of cosmic neutrinos. The KM3NeT neutrino detector is being con- structed in the deep Mediterranean sea to detect this ux. Neutrinos of all avors can induce a detectable particle shower in the detector. The direction and energy of this shower gives an estimate of the direction and energy of the neutrino. In this research, a method has been developed to reconstruct the parameters of neutrino- induced showers with energies > 104 GeV in the KM3NeT detector. The performance of the reconstruction method has been tested using simulated shower events. The shower direction can be reconstructed with a median error in the direction of less than 2. The energy resolution is 15\%. By selecting a subset of the reconstructed events, a direction resolution better than 1 can be achieved. The estimated shower position may be suciently accurate to distinguish between electron-and tau-neutrinos. This could lead to a neutrino source analysis based on all properties of detected neutrinos.},

@article{Investigation2008,
abstract = {On 7 October 2008, an Airbus A330-303 aircraft, registered VH-QPA and operated as Qantas flight 72, departed Singapore on a scheduled passenger transport service to Perth, Western Australia. While the aircraft was in cruise at 37,000 ft, one of the aircraft’s three air data inertial reference units (ADIRUs) started outputting intermittent, incorrect values (spikes) on all flight parameters to other aircraft systems. Two minutes later, in response to spikes in angle of attack (AOA) data, the aircraft’s flight control primary computers (FCPCs) commanded the aircraft to pitch down. At least 110 of the 303 passengers and nine of the 12 crew members were injured; 12 of the occupants were seriously injured and another 39 received hospital medical treatment. Although the FCPC algorithm for processing AOA data was generally very effective, it could not manage a scenario where there were multiple spikes in AOA from one ADIRU that were 1.2 seconds apart. The occurrence was the only known example where this design limitation led to a pitch-down command in over 28 million flight hours on A330/A340 aircraft, and the aircraft manufacturer subsequently redesigned the AOA algorithm to prevent the same type of accident from occurring again. Each of the intermittent data spikes was probably generated when the LTN-101 ADIRU’s central processor unit (CPU) module combined the data value from one parameter with the label for another parameter. The failure mode was probably initiated by a single, rare type of internal or external trigger event combined with a marginal susceptibility to that type of event within a hardware component. There were only three known occasions of the failure mode in over 128 million hours of unit operation. At the aircraft manufacturer’s request, the ADIRU manufacturer has modified the LTN-101 ADIRU to improve its ability to detect data transmission failures. At least 60 of the aircraft’s passengers were seated without their seat belts fastened at the time of the first pitch-down. The injury rate and injury severity was substantially greater for those who were not seated or seated without their seat belts fastened. The investigation identified several lessons or reminders for the manufacturers of complex, safety-critical systems.},

abstract = {This paper examines the effect of technology scaling and microarchitectural trends on the rate of soft errors in CMOS memory and logic circuits. We describe and validate an end-to-end model that enables us to compute the soft error rates (SER) for existing and future microprocessor-style designs. The model captures the effects of two important masking phenomena, electrical masking and latching-window masking, which inhibit soft errors in combinational logic. We quantify the SER due to high-energy neutrons in SRAM cells, latches, and logic circuits for feature sizes from 600 nm to 50 nm and clock periods from 16 to 6 fan-out-of-4 inverter delays. Our model predicts that the SER per chip of logic circuits will increase nine orders of magnitude from 1992 to 2011 and at that point will be comparable to the SER per chip of unprotected memory elements. Our result emphasizes that computer system designers must address the risks of soft errors in logic circuits for future designs.},
