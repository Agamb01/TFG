abstract = {We propose a fault-tolerant approach to reliable microprocessor design. Our approach, based on the use of an online checker component in the processor pipeline, provides significant resistance to core processor design errors and operational faults such as supply voltage noise and energetic particle strikes. We show through cycle-accurate simulation and timing analysis of a physical checker design that our approach preserves system performance while keeping area overheads and power demands low. Furthermore, analyses suggest that the checker is a fairly simple state machine that can be formally verified, scaled in performance, and reused. Further simulation analyses show virtually no performance impacts when our simple checker design is coupled with a high-performance microprocessor model. Timing analyses indicate that a fully synthesized unpipelined 4-wide checker component in 0.25 \&amp;mu;m technology is capable of checking Alpha instructions at 288 MHz. Physical analyses also confirm that costs are quite modest; our prototype checker requires less than 6\% the area and 1.5\% the power of an Alpha 21264 processor in the same technology. Additional improvements to the checker component are described which allow for improved detection of design, fabrication and operational faults.},

The processors tolerates transient SEU errors by using techniques such as TMR registers, on-chip EDAC, parity, pipeline restart, and forced cache miss. The first prototypes were manufactured on the Atmel ATC35 0.35 \&amp;mu;m CMOS process, and subjected to heavy-ion fault-injection at the Louvain Cyclotron. The heavy-ion tests showed that all of the injected errors (>100,000) were successfully corrected without timing or software impact. The device SEU threshold was measured to be below 6 MeV while ion energy-levels of up to 110 MeV were used for error injection.},

@article{Rotenberg1999,
abstract = {This paper speculates that technology trends pose new challenges for fault tolerance in microprocessors. Specifically, severely reduced design tolerances implied by gigaherz clock rates may result in frequent and arbitrary transient faults. We suggest that existing fault-tolerant techniques-system-level, gate-level, or component-specific approaches-are either too costly for general purpose computing, overly intrusive to the design, or insufficient for covering arbitrary logic faults. An approach in which the microarchitecture itself provides fault tolerance is required. We propose a new time redundancy fault-tolerant approach in which a program is duplicated and the two redundant programs simultaneously run on the processor: The technique exploits several significant microarchitectural trends to provide broad coverage of transient faults and restricted coverage of permanent faults. These trends are simultaneous multithreading, control flow and data flow prediction, and hierarchical processors-all of which are intended for higher performance, but which can be easily leveraged for the specified fault tolerance goals. The overhead for achieving fault tolerance is low, both in terms of performance and changes to the existing microarchitecture. Detailed simulations of five of the SPEC95 benchmarks show that executing two redundant programs on the fault-tolerant microarchitecture takes only 10\% to 30\% longer than running a single version of the program},

@book{Investigation2008,
abstract = {On 7 October 2008, an Airbus A330-303 aircraft, registered VH-QPA and operated as Qantas flight 72, departed Singapore on a scheduled passenger transport service to Perth, Western Australia. While the aircraft was in cruise at 37,000 ft, one of the aircraft’s three air data inertial reference units (ADIRUs) started outputting intermittent, incorrect values (spikes) on all flight parameters to other aircraft systems. Two minutes later, in response to spikes in angle of attack (AOA) data, the aircraft’s flight control primary computers (FCPCs) commanded the aircraft to pitch down. At least 110 of the 303 passengers and nine of the 12 crew members were injured; 12 of the occupants were seriously injured and another 39 received hospital medical treatment. Although the FCPC algorithm for processing AOA data was generally very effective, it could not manage a scenario where there were multiple spikes in AOA from one ADIRU that were 1.2 seconds apart. The occurrence was the only known example where this design limitation led to a pitch-down command in over 28 million flight hours on A330/A340 aircraft, and the aircraft manufacturer subsequently redesigned the AOA algorithm to prevent the same type of accident from occurring again. Each of the intermittent data spikes was probably generated when the LTN-101 ADIRU’s central processor unit (CPU) module combined the data value from one parameter with the label for another parameter. The failure mode was probably initiated by a single, rare type of internal or external trigger event combined with a marginal susceptibility to that type of event within a hardware component. There were only three known occasions of the failure mode in over 128 million hours of unit operation. At the aircraft manufacturer’s request, the ADIRU manufacturer has modified the LTN-101 ADIRU to improve its ability to detect data transmission failures. At least 60 of the aircraft’s passengers were seated without their seat belts fastened at the time of the first pitch-down. The injury rate and injury severity was substantially greater for those who were not seated or seated without their seat belts fastened. The investigation identified several lessons or reminders for the manufacturers of complex, safety-critical systems.},

The KM3NeT neutrino detector is being con- structed in the deep Mediterranean sea to detect this ux. Neutrinos of all avors can induce a detectable particle shower in the detector. The direction and energy of this shower gives an estimate of the direction and energy of the neutrino. In this research, a method has been developed to reconstruct the parameters of neutrino- induced showers with energies > 104 GeV in the KM3NeT detector. The performance of the reconstruction method has been tested using simulated shower events. The shower direction can be reconstructed with a median error in the direction of less than 2. The energy resolution is 15\%. By selecting a subset of the reconstructed events, a direction resolution better than 1 can be achieved. The estimated shower position may be suciently accurate to distinguish between electron-and tau-neutrinos. This could lead to a neutrino source analysis based on all properties of detected neutrinos.},
